# FPGA_VideoSoftware
Implements a custom search algorithm to find a window of values within a larger frame of values. This is ran through a 5-stage pipelined, custom data path that is functional on an FPGA.
The "Files for Implementation" folder has all the necessary design sources and simulation sources for running the program

IMPORTANT: Make sure to make Top_Board the top design file and Top_tb the top simulation file. Also use the xc7a100tcsg324-1 board.
